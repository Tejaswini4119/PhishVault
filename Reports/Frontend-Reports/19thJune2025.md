## Completed Tasks:

`Key Updates Implemented`:
Introduced Reusable Components:

## VerdictBadge:
A new component to display the scan verdict ("Safe", "Suspicious", "Malicious") using color-coded badges.
This improves visual clarity and ensures consistent badge styling across the app.

## Loader:
A simple loading spinner was created and reused to replace the plain “Loading…” text.
This provides a more professional and user-friendly experience when data is being fetched.

`Updated ReportPage.jsx to Use Components`:

Imported VerdictBadge and Loader components at the top:
import VerdictBadge from '../components/VerdictBadge';
import Loader from '../components/Loader';

Replaced the manually styled verdict span with the reusable <VerdictBadge verdict={report.verdict} />.
This cleaned up the JSX and made the file easier to maintain.

Replaced the simple `loading text`:
from: if (loading) return <div>Loading report...</div>;
to: if (loading) return <Loader />;

`Improved Error Handling`:

Preserved the try/catch structure using Axios inside useEffect.
Ensured that backend failure and report-not-found cases return clear messages to the user.
File Structure & `Reusability Improvements`:
Created a /components folder to store all reusable UI components.
Maintained a clean and modular file layout for better scalability and collaboration.

With these updates, the Report Viewer page is now modular, consistent, and easier to scale. This improves both the developer experience and the interface shown to users. Future improvements like exporting reports or filtering scan logs can now be added more easily.
