# PhishVault Threat Detection Validation - Daily Report

**Date:** 27th June 2025  
**Author:** PardhuVarma  
**Environment:** Local Ubuntu VM  
**Component:** `phishvault-backend`

---

## ðŸ§ª Test Objective

To validate whether PhishVault can successfully identify a locally hosted HTML-based phishing page using heuristic analysis.

---

## ðŸ§  Test Scenario

- A custom phishing HTML page was served locally using `npx serve` on port `3000`.
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/phishtest-site`
- The HTML page included:
  - Password input field
  - Form action pointing to a **malicious external domain** (`http://attacker.com/login`)
  - Suspicious phishing keywords: `login`, `sign in`, `verify`, `account`

---

## ðŸ§° Detection Modules Enabled

- âœ… Password field detection  
- âœ… External form action analyzer  
- âœ… HTML phishing keyword scanner  
- âœ… Console log error reporting  
- âœ… Redirect chain tracking  
- âœ… Cookie sniffing

## ðŸ“¦ API Result (JSON)

```json
{
  "scanId": "685e2e79e3a66227a51c83e4",
  "verdict": "Malicious",
  "score": 10,
  "notes": [
    "Password field found",
    "Form action points to external domain: attacker.com",
    "Suspicious keyword found: \"login\"",
    "Suspicious keyword found: \"sign in\"",
    "Suspicious keyword found: \"verify\"",
    "Suspicious keyword found: \"account\""
  ]
}

```
## Conclusion
PhishVault accurately identified the local phishing test page as Malicious based on static DOM heuristics and metadata analysis.

- This proves that: 

   - HTML-based phishing payloads without live JS behavior are detectable.

   - Static evaluation is reliable enough for many phishing use cases.

   - Backend heuristic engine is working as expected.
