## Completed Tasks:

- Set up the React project using Vite and integrated `Tailwind CSS` for styling. 
- Built a responsive form with an input field and a submit button.
- Connected the form to the `backend API using Axios`.
- Implemented navigation using `React Router` to redirect users to the report page after submission.
- Added `toast notifications`- (success and error messages) for user feedback.
- Handled loading state and error cases such as invalid URLs or backend failures.

---

## UX Focus:

- Clean and minimal design
- Responsive layout
- Clear feedback during loading and error scenarios

This submission page sets the foundation for the entire app, making sure users can interact with the system smoothly and confidently.
Ready to move on to building the full scan report viewer in the next phase
