# Contributing Guidelines

> **⚠️ INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY ⚠️**

### ⛔ No External Contributions

We are **not** accepting pull requests, issues, or feature requests from external contributors at this time. This project is strictly for the authorized development team.

### 🔐 Security Reporting

If you identify a security vulnerability in the scanning or analysis logic, please report it directly to the Lead Developers via internal communication channels (Slack/Email). **DO NOT** open a public issue.

### 🛠 Team Guidelines (Internal)

For authorized team members (`Dev 1`, `Dev 2`):

1. **Branching**: Use feature branches `feature/phase-x-module`.
2. **Commits**: Follow Semantic Commit Messages (e.g., `feat: added visual hashing`).
3. **Reviews**: All PRs must pass the `go test` suite and receive 1 approval.
