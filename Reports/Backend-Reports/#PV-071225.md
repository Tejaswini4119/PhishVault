# **Case #PV-071225: “The Mysterious Case of the Ghost Port (4002)”**

---

### 📅 Date of Occurrence:
**12 July 2025**

### 🧑‍💻 Reported By:
**PardhuVarma**  
*Lead Backend Developer, PhishVault*

---

### 📌 Incident Summary:

A mysterious behavior was observed in the PhishVault backend setup — although all Docker configurations and the backend server were set to run on **port 4000**, the application was somehow accessible at **port 4002** as well. No configuration, Dockerfile, or environment variable referenced this ghost port.

This led to confusion regarding container routing, port mappings, and possible daemon leakage or port shadowing behavior.

---

### 🔎 Investigation Timeline:

| Time       | Action |
|------------|--------|
| 09:45 AM   | Docker containers started as usual (`docker-compose up`) with backend bound to **4000**. |
| 09:48 AM   | Application verified to be accessible at **4002** — despite no mention of it in any config. |
| 09:50 AM   | Checked all `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `server.js`, and `.env` files — all pointed to **4000**. |
| 09:53 AM   | Suspected OS-level port hijacking or misconfigured container runtime. |
| 10:00 AM   | Ran `lsof -i :4002` → revealed a **native Node.js instance running on port 4002**. |
| 10:02 AM   | Found the culprit: a **Bash startup script (`backend-start.sh`)** contained the line `node server.js`, which launched a second instance *outside Docker* on port **4002**. |
| 10:05 AM   | 🧠 Realization: Two PhishVault backend instances were running simultaneously — one in Docker (port 4000), one on host machine (port 4002). |
| 10:10 AM   | Removed the rogue line from startup script. 🪦 Ghost exorcised. |

---

### 📌 Root Cause:

> An unintentional `node server.js` call in the backend startup script led to spawning a **host-native backend** listening on port **4002** — entirely separate from the containerized backend.

---

### 🩹 Resolution:

1. Cleaned and corrected the backend startup script.
2. Removed `node server.js` to prevent native server spawning.
3. Confirmed Docker-managed server is only one running on port **4000**.
4. Added diagnostic `lsof` checks to future debugging process.

---

### ✅ Outcome:

- Backend is now running **only via Docker** on port **4000**.  
- Host port **4002** is free — no ghost sightings since.  
- Developer paranoia level: reduced from 😱 to 😅.

---

### 📚 Lessons Learned:

- 🔍 **Check host processes (`lsof`, `ps aux`, `netstat`)** before assuming a misconfigured Docker container.
- 🧼 **Always review startup scripts** when ghost behavior occurs.
- 💭 Even ghosts are just forgotten commands haunting you from the past.

---

### 🧠 Suggested Future Enhancements:

| Enhancement | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Add a port check before launching any server | Avoid accidental multiple instances |
| Refactor all startup logic into Docker-only paths | Single source of truth |
| Integrate `Makefile` or `npm run dev:docker` | Cleaner workflow with strict environment awareness |
