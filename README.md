### 🤝 Collaboration & Development Approach

PhishVault was built with the following principles:

- **Division of Responsibilities:** Clear separation between frontend (UI/UX, logic) and backend (infrastructure, orchestration, processing).
- **Simplicity over Complexity:** Every feature was built with clarity and future maintainability in mind.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Fast iteration cycles with structured API tests and modular rollouts.
- **Security Focused:** Every decision, from Puppeteer isolation to verdict logic, was grounded in real-world threat behavior.
